## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI** (Dashboard, KPI cards, Line, Pie)
- **VS Code** for development

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Highlights (`analysis.py`)

- Renamed columns for consistency.
- Converted date columns to datetime.
- Removed duplicates.
- Added calculated fields:
  - `order_month`: Monthly period grouping
  - `profit_margin`: Profit to Sales ratio
- Exported cleaned data as `sample.csv` for use in Power BI.


## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (`eda.py`)

The EDA script produced insights through visualizations such as:

- **Sales vs. Profit by Category/Sub-Category**
- **Region-wise Performance**
- **Monthly Sales Trend**
- **Top 10 Customers by Revenue**
- **State-wise Sales Heatmap**

All charts are saved as PNGs in the `Output/` directory.

|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dropdown Slicer           | Filter data by city, country, and region                                 |
| Pie Chart                 | Displays the sum of sales and profit by region                           |
| Clustered Column Chart    | Compares total sales and profit across different regions                 |
| Line and Clustered Column | Shows yearly trend of sales and profit                                   |
| Bar Chart                 | Visualizes total yearly sales                                            |
| KPI Card with Area Chart  | Shows monthly sales, profit, and profit margin with KPI target indicator |

✅ **All visuals are interactive and filterable** by region, time period, and location dimensions.
